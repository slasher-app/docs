# Caret

In Slasher it is possible to decide where to place the caret in a text field. This can be done using the special syntax `%caret%`.

So, for example if you wanted to place the caret at the middle of your replacement text you could write:

```
> [!note]
> Cool note! Insert my caret here: %caret% and then continue the text.
```
