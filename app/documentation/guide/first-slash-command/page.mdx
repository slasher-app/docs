# Your First Slash Command

When you first install Slasher, you will by default have no commands. So, in order to get started, you need to create one. Let's walk through the steps.

## Creating a Slash Command

Start by accessing Slasher by clicking the extension icon in your browser toolbar. You will see an empty command list and a button to add a new command. Now press "Add New Slash Command" and fill out the form. Press "Save Command"

... **and that is it!** You have successfully created your first slash command 🎉

### Example

For example, let's create a command that inserts a super cool cat emoji:

![Emoji Slash Command](/main-ui-add-emoji-command.png)

Press "Save Command"

> [!note]
>
> Note the website entered here in this command. Slasher supports Glob patterns for matching which website the command should be available on. The pattern here matches everything. To learn more about Glob patterns, visit the advanced guide: [Glob Patterns](/advanced/glob-patterns).
